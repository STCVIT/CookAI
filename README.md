## Features

- The app is targeted at general users and people who are willing to explore new recipes and find suitable recipes for the ingredients they have. It has a  vast variety of ingredients and recipes for the users to explore and relish.
- After acquiring the ingredient given by the users, it is passed on to the Ranking Algorithm which then compares the recipe Ingredients and user Ingredients and decreases the count value for each Recipe ingredient missing.
- Count describes the no. of ingredients missing from user ingredients to make that recipe.
- After Acquiring the top 100 recipes, we use an Advanced string similarity algorithm and rank the algorithm again. In this way, we have reduced the processing time to a mere 3 seconds.

More features coming soon!
